## Learning reflaction 

 **Sunday**
 
Actually I was really anxious in Monday, because I know nothing about computing.
Also I am remote learner, so I only can get information from reading list, at the first I can’t figure out what is readme file, markdown and GitHub. And I’m not good at self-study.
 
 
 
 **Tuesday** 

I talked to Maggie in tutorial about my anxiety, she said I just need to do this, if I had problem I can get help from teachers or classmate. Then I read all information on Moodle, get help for friends. 

**Wednesday** 

I don’t feel nervous anymore and started to do things. :innocent:
I read some basic information about computing

**Thursday**

*suggestions for remote learners*
1. Don't be anxious about something you don't konw, you will figure out!
2. Don't be afirad to ask questions, to your tutor and your classmate.
3. Read all information in reading list, especially Jazmin‘s notes and "README File – Everything you Need to Know"
4. Good luck!
