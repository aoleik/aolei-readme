## Learning reflaction 

 **Monday**
 
Actually I was really anxious in Monday, because I know nothing about computing.
Also I am remote learner, so I only can get information from reading list, at the first I can’t figure out what is readme file, markdown and GitHub. And I’m not good at self-study.
 
 
 
 **Tuesday** 

I talked to Maggie in tutorial about my anxiety, she said I just need to do this, if I had problem I can get help from teachers or classmate. Then I read all information on Moodle, get help for friends. 

**Wednesday** 

I don’t feel nervous anymore and started to do things. :innocent:
I read some basic information about computing

readme file：https://www.mygreatlearning.com/blog/readme-file/#Q2

p5j: https://p5js.org/community/
 
markdown:https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/

creative computing community by Jazmin:https://moodle.arts.ac.uk/pluginfile.php/1152359/mod_resource/content/4/GCD_Unit2_2122%20Creative%20Computing%20Community%20%281%29.pdf

And I tried the TinkerCAD.

Although I still don't understant about TinkerCAD but I'm really interested in it.

TinkerCAD Makes me think about  a popular art work in china called *modern art driver*.
That is a sample circuit board with little screen, which can create random sentence. Sounds like some wired poem .

That says “Modern Achieve Compulsive Road of No Return”

That says“Why  Deprive   the most stupit system”

She collect 60 words all those words are from art history books or some essays about art. I think that is a good sample to make art work about computing.

**Thursday**

**Reflection**

I learnt many things about computing that I never heard before, at the first time I really afriad abot coding but after I finishd the reading list I started to do something. Although that's really sample but is a good start of me, I'm looking forward to learn more about computing.

*Suggestions for remote learners*
1. Don't be anxious about something you don't konw, you will figure out!
2. Don't be afirad to ask questions, to your tutor and your classmate.
3. Read all information in reading list, especially Jazmin‘s notes and "README File – Everything you Need to Know"
4. Imagination is really improtant.
5. Good luck!
